This is a statement regarding COVID-19 and how it affects notGDC Michigan 2020 on Saturday, March 14.

notGDC Michigan was organized in part because of the rich community of game developers in Michigan, and because of the official postponement of GDC in San Francisco - our event would be an alternative for local developers who had to cancel travel plans. As of Wednesday, March 11, 2020, a limited number of cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Michigan, and many public schools have taken action for the safety of their students and staff.

The common guideline both in Michigan and for events across the United States is to cancel or postpone any international events that gather more than 100 people (this includes internal guidelines from LTU, the location of notGDC Michigan). At the time of this writing, many events and festivals across the country are still proceeding as planned, provided they meet this restriction. Likewise, notGDC Michigan is estimated to have less than 50 attendees, all from within the local state. Therefore, the event will proceed as planned, but we are monitoring the situation closely and will update this post if things change.

We will ask that attendees be respectful of those around them to prevent potential spread of disease. General tips include washing your hands regularly with soap and water, avoid sneezing or coughing into the air (use your sleeves!) and avoiding direct physical contact with others (find alternative greetings besides shaking hands). If you feel sick, we recommend staying home to prevent potential spread to others. If you have recently traveled outside of North America or have concerns about spread to loved-ones you have regular contact with, we encourage caution and accept last-minute decisions to not attend.

At this time, we are not planning to hold a live online stream of notGDC Michigan, but we are making plans to record the event, with materials to be made public at a date in the near future.
